### Website Data Table Pages

We also have two different pages where you can see Covid-19 data from around the world and Covid-19 data from each state in the U.S.
We provide the name of each country, confirmed cases, recovered patients, deaths, and new cases from each country under the world data page.

In our US data page we provide the name of each state and territory, the number of confirmed cases, deaths, new cases, and number of currently infected within their respective states.

Both data tables are up to date with the current data available and updates automatically.
